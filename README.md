Personal Case study video and a link to my Wordpress critical reflection journal. 
To understanding the learning process throughout this course, it would be best to start off reading my critical reflection journal which includes blog posts about my research, development, activities and practice throughout the past 12 weeks, and includes video demonstrations of my rapid ideation wireframes.

To summarise my learning, aims, accomplishments and outlined modifications, the video is where there is further critical analysis which refers to back to the blog posts and explains how learning has been developed from them. This can be found in the case study file within this folder.
